# Attendance_Android_App
Android App to manage Attendance in colleges.

Sir!!,Can you please tell me if I'm falling short of my attendence in your subject,otherwise I fear i might get detained...
(cluster of students encircle the teacher). Teacher immediately leaves the classroom saying-"Get lost everyone,
I have other important works to do,search for your name in detainee list to get that!!!"
This app is a boon for current students of schools,colleges and universities in the sense that it provides them the 
ability to maintain and keep track of their own attendence system.

Concepts: 

activity, service, broadcast receiver, content provider, intent, AndroidManifest
